/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_testset
 *
 * Description:
 *   Perform and atomic test and set operation on the provided spinlock.
 *
 *   This function must be provided via the architecture-specific logoic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   lock - The address of spinlock object.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The spinlock is always locked upon return.  The value of previous value
 *   of the spinlock variable is returned, either SP_LOCKED if the spinlock
 *   as previously locked (meaning that the test-and-set operation failed to
 *   obtain the lock) or SP_UNLOCKED if the spinlock was previously unlocked
 *   (meaning that we successfully obtained the lock)

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: spinlock
 *
 * Description:
 *   Loop until the spinlock is successfully locked.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   lock - The address of spinlock object.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None.  When the function returned, the spinlocked was successfully
 *   locked by this CPU.
